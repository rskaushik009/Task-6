# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## **Objective**
Understand what makes a password strong, test multiple passwords against password strength tools, and identify best practices for password security.

## **Tools Used**
- [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com)
- [Bitwarden Password Strength Checker](https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/)

## **Observations**
1. **Length increases security** – Passwords longer than 12 characters score significantly higher.
2. **Mixing character types** (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) greatly improves strength.
3. **Avoid common words** – Predictable dictionary words make passwords vulnerable.
4. **Randomness matters** – Adding special characters in unpredictable ways improves security.

---

## **Best Practices for Strong Passwords**
- Use **at least 12–16 characters**.
- Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**.
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns.
- Don’t reuse the same password across multiple accounts.
- Consider using **passphrases** (e.g., `Blue$Tiger*Runs2025`).
- Store passwords in a **password manager** for safety.

---

## **Common Password Attacks**
- **Brute Force Attack** – Tries all possible combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack** – Uses common word/password lists.
- **Credential Stuffing** – Uses stolen credentials from data breaches.

---

## **Summary**
Password complexity directly impacts how resistant it is to cracking attempts.  
Short, simple passwords can be broken in seconds, while long, complex ones may take centuries.  
Following best practices and using a password manager ensures stronger security.

## **Outcome**
✅ Learned how to create strong passwords  
✅ Tested passwords using online tools  
✅ Identified best practices and security threats related to passwords
