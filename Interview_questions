1.What makes a password strong?
A strong password is long (12â€“16+ characters), uses a mix of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, is unique for each account, and avoids dictionary words or predictable patterns.

2.What are common password attacks?
Common attacks include brute force, dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, phishing, keylogging, rainbow tables, password spraying, and social engineering.

3.Why is password length important?
Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack because they increase the total number of possible combinations an attacker must try.

4.What is a dictionary attack?
An attack that tries passwords from a list of common words, passwords, or leaked credentials to quickly guess a password.

5.What is multi-factor authentication?
A security method requiring two or more verification steps, such as a password plus a one-time code sent to your phone, making unauthorized access harder.

6.How do password managers help?
They store complex, unique passwords securely and auto-fill them, allowing you to avoid weak or reused passwords without having to remember them.

7.What are passphrases?
Long sequences of random or unrelated words (often with symbols or numbers) that are easier to remember but still highly secure. Example: Blue$Tiger*Runs2025.

8.What are common mistakes in password creation?
Using short passwords, common words, personal details (birthdays, names), predictable patterns, or reusing the same password for multiple accounts.
