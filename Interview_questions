# Password Security Interview Questions – Task 6

## 1. What makes a password strong?
A strong password is:
- Long (12–16+ characters)
- Uses a mix of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
- Unique for each account
- Avoids dictionary words and predictable patterns

---

## 2. What are common password attacks?
Common password attacks include:
- **Brute Force** – Trying all possible combinations
- **Dictionary Attack** – Using common words/password lists
- **Credential Stuffing** – Using stolen credentials from breaches
- **Phishing** – Tricking users into revealing credentials
- **Keylogging** – Recording keystrokes to capture passwords
- **Rainbow Table Attack** – Using precomputed hash tables
- **Password Spraying** – Trying a few common passwords across accounts
- **Social Engineering** – Manipulating people into revealing passwords

---

## 3. Why is password length important?
Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack because they increase the total number of possible character combinations, making brute force attacks less effective.

---

## 4. What is a dictionary attack?
A method where attackers try passwords from a pre-made list of common words, passwords, or leaked credentials to guess a password quickly.

---

## 5. What is multi-factor authentication?
A security method requiring two or more verification steps, such as:
- Password + one-time code sent to a phone
- Password + fingerprint
This makes unauthorized access much harder.

---

## 6. How do password managers help?
Password managers:
- Store complex, unique passwords securely
- Auto-fill login forms
- Help avoid weak or reused passwords
- Encrypt stored passwords for safety

---

## 7. What are passphrases?
Passphrases are long sequences of random or unrelated words, often with numbers or symbols, that are easier to remember but still secure.  
**Example:** `Blue$Tiger*Runs2025`

---

## 8. What are common mistakes in password creation?
- Using short passwords
- Using common words or patterns (`123456`, `password`)
- Using personal info (birthdays, names)
- Reusing the same password across multiple accounts
- Avoiding symbols and complexity
